With the emergence of LLMs and their integration with other data modalities,
 multi-modal 3D perception attracts more attention due to its connectivity to the
 physical world and makes rapid progress. However, limited by existing datasets,
 previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object
 spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds <b>the
 first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical
 grounded language annotations, MMScan.</b> It is constructed based on a top-down
 logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relation
ships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall
 pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize
 the annotations efficiently and further involve humans’ correction in the loop to
 ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon exist
ing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M
 meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M
 diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We
 evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in
 different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future.
 Furthermore, we use this high-quality dataset to train state-of-the-art 3D visual
 grounding and LLMs and obtain remarkable performance improvement both on
 existing benchmarks and in-the-wild evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started:

### Installation

1. Clone Github repo.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:rbler1234/MMScan.git
    cd MMScan
    ```

2. Install requirements. 

    Your environment needs to include Python version 3.8 or higher.

    ```shell
    conda activate your_env_name
    python intall.py --all 
    ```

    You can "--VG/QA" if you only need either one of the two.

### Data Preparation

## 👓 MMScan API Tutorial

You can import MMScan API in this way:
```bash
    import mmscan_tool

    (1) the dataset tool
    import mmscan_tool.MMScan as MMScan_dataset

    (2) the evaluator tool ('VG'/'QA'/'GPT')
    import mmscan_tool.{}_Evaluator as MMScan_{}_evaluator
```

#### MMScan Dataset

We offer a tool that allows you to easily obtain the data required by the models in the MMScan task.
```bash
    my_dataset = MMScan_dataloder(split='train',task="MMScan-QA",ratio=1.0)
    # the train split of MMScan QA task, the down sample ratio is 1.0
    print(my_dataset[100])
```

You can conveniently use `__get_item__` to access them. Each item is a dictonary containing the following keys:

( 0 ) Index of this sample

( 1 ) 3D modality
```
        "ori_pcds" (tuple[tensor]): the raw data read from the pth file.

        "pcds" (np.ndarray):  the point cloud data of the scan,
                            [n_points, 6(xyz+rgb)]

        "instance_labels" (np.ndarray): the instance id of each point,

#### MMScan  Evaluator
We offer a tool that allows you to easily evaluate the model output in the MMScan task.

(1) Visual grounding evaluator

for visual grounding task, our evaluator calculate the metric AP, AR, multi-topk.
```bash
    # whether to show the progress
    my_evaluator = MMScan_VG_evaluator(verbose=True)
    # the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format.
    my_evaluator.update(model_output)
    metric_dict = my_evaluator.start_evaluation()
    # Optional 1, get the sample-level result
    print(my_evaluator.records)
    # Optional 2, get the sample-level result
    print(my_evaluator.print_result())

    # You should reset the evaluator!
    my_evaluator.reset()
```
the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format:
```
        "pred_scores" (tensor/ndarray): the confidence for each pred.
                                        (num_pred,1)

        "pred_bboxes"/"gt_bboxes" (tensor/ndarray): the list of 9 DoF box.
                  Support for two input mode:
                    1. 9-dim 9 DoF bounding box (num_pred/gt, 9)
                    2. center, size and rot matrix
                    ("center": (num_pred/gt, 3),
                      "size" : (num_pred/gt, 3),
                       "rot" : (num_pred/gt, 3, 3))
        "subclass": the subclass in the VG samples.
        "index" :
```
(2) Question Answering evaluator

for question answering task, our evaluator calculate the metric Bleu-X, Metor, CiDer, Spice, Simcse, Sbert, EM, Refine EM
```bash
    # model_config stores the pretrain weights of SIMCSE and SBERT
    my_evaluator = MMScan_QA_evaluator(model_config={},verbose=True)
    # the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format.
    my_evaluator.update(model_output)
    metric_dict = my_evaluator.start_evaluation()
    # Optional 1, get the sample-level result
    print(my_evaluator.records)

    # You should reset the evaluator!
    my_evaluator.reset()
```

the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format:
```
        "qusetion"(str)
        "pred" (list[str]): the prediction, length should be equal 1.
        "gt" (list[str]): the prediction, length should be larger than 1.
        "ID": the ID in the QA samples, should be unique.
        "index"
```

(3) GPT evaluator

for question answering task, we alse provide GPT evaluator, which we 
think it's more reasonable to use.
```bash
    # whether to show the progress
    my_evaluator = MMScan_GPT_Evaluator(API_key='XXX')
    # the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format.
    # tmp_path to store the result from multi-process
    metric_dict = my_evaluator.load_and_eval(model_output, num_threads=5, tmp_path ='XXX')
   
    my_evaluator.reset()
```
the input to the evaluator should be in a certain format:
```
        "qusetion"(str)
        "pred" (list[str]): the prediction, length should be equal 1.
        "gt" (list[str]): the prediction, length should be larger than 1.
        "ID": the ID in the QA samples, should be unique.
        "index"
```
